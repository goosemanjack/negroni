#summary Basic overview and instructions on implementing data controls

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />


= Introduction =

One of the most useful aspects of OpenSocial and the Negroni framework is the ability to define declarative data tags and use them in rendering and processing.  Data tags declare in markup the piece of data you wish to retrieve and the key to place it under in the data context.  This document looks at some basic mechanisms for building data controls


= Data Controls =

Data controls are created in much the same way as other controls.  They have a *`MarkupTag`* attribute to identify the tag to parse.  They also inherit from one of the base controls.  Data controls should all inherit from *`Negroni.TemplateFramework.BaseDataControl`*.  This tags them as a recognized data control to the Negroni framework.

== Data Resolution ==

Data resolution may be handled either inline during the Render phase, or prior to render with an *`IDataPipelineResolver`* implementation.  Using a data pipeline resolver adds more complexity to your data controls, but it allows for greater control of how and when the data is fetched.

When using the simpler inline render resolution, your widget authors must include the data tag prior to any usages of the data.  When using a data pipeline resolver, the data tags can appear anywhere since there is an entire data resolution pass prior to the render pass.

== Creating a Data Control ==

In the _WebNoSql_ sample project, the site its self makes use of data controls to display the list of available gadgets.  Our data control loads the file list into the DataContext.  Then the Negroni widget uses a simple repeater to generate links for all available gadgets.

The first step is to define the basic control class.  We define our data control to be recognized under the tag *sample:GadgetList*

{{{
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;

using Negroni.TemplateFramework;
using Negroni.DataPipeline;

namespace WebNoSql.SiteOSML
{
  [Negroni.TemplateFramework.MarkupTag("sample:GadgetList")]
  public class GadgetFileList : BaseDataControl
  {
  }
}

}}}

Notice how we inherit from *`BaseDataControl`* instead of `BaseGadgetControl` or `BaseContainerControl`.  That allows Negroni to recognize this as a data control and register it with the widget's DataContext during parsing.

The next step is to implement the code to fetch the data.  We're not using a pipeline resolver, but its still good practice to tie data resolution to the `InvokeTarget()` method in case you want to switch from render-time resolution to pipeline resolution prior to render.  This code also calls `InvokeTarget` from within the render method, using a flag value to insure it's not called multiple times.

The data is a listing of all XML files found in a reserved folder of the app.

          string[] foo = Directory.GetFiles(path, "*.xml");

          _gadgetList = new List<string>();
          int len = path.Length;
          for (int i = 0; i < foo.Length; i++)
          {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(foo[i])
              && foo[i].Length + 1 >= len)

              _gadgetList.Add(foo[i].Substring(len + 1));
